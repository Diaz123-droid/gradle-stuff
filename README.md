# Original Readme.md

This is project is solely a gradle learning project. Nothing much.

## Purpose

> It will be ever changing. Until I find anything good to use it for,
theres nothing useful that should come of it!
> If you do find this project interesting, please do add some changes
to your liking.

## 0.0.1 Release Notes

    Created the project using gradle. The project has a test. It takes an
argument `en` or `es` for english or spanish respectively and produces
an output which is a hardcoded word hello for `en` and hola for `es`
when the en or es arguments are passed.

    The test uses junit as its test dependency from marven central repo.
build.gradle.kts is where all the dependencies are invoked. This project
is meant to be complete yet simple for learning gradle and git concurrently.
